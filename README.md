Nicolas Cage

Use this executable to prank your friends.  Get it to execute on their computer somehow.  Timer, script, whatever.  That part is up to you.

Download it here:  https://github.com/nylen/cage/raw/master/bin/Debug/cage.exe

All it does is show this image in a partially transparent window that allows click-through:

Press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F12` to close the program (or kill it using Task Manager).

Go through the source code and compile it yourself if you're into that sort of thing.
